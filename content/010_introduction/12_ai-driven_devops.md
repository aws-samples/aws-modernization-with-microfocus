# The Role of AI in the Future
UFT One is a natural citizen in the DevOps world. Its open architecture and CI/CD integrations support multiple testing strategies, eliminate bottlenecks, and increase efficiencies across your lifecycle. UFT One's DevOps-enabled toolchain also provides continuous testing support for open source, third-party, and Micro Focus solutions from [version control](https://admhelp.microfocus.com/uft/en/latest/UFT_Help/Content/User_Guide/UFT_SVN_Integration.htm?Highlight=version%20control) to [continuous integration](https://admhelp.microfocus.com/uft/en/latest/UFT_Help/Content/User_Guide/ci-tools.htm?Highlight=continuous%20integration) to agile management.

When reading the tea leaves on the forward direction of DevOps and continuous testing, there's no doubt that the future will be AI-driven. AI is already an asset in DevOps today as it enhances the application development process and makes testing more efficient. Updating your repository from sensitive property-based objects to AI-based objects increases the resiliency of your tests and reduces maintenance time. Having your objects on an AI neural network also increases speed of your tests.
